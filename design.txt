Problem Statement:
  A program is required that has a fun and silly IQ test that "measures" a user's intelligence through a series of wacky questions. The user gets two choices per question, and depending on their answer, the IQ score will either increase or decrease. After the IQ test, the user will input their favorite music genres. Then based off the user's results, a selection of music that they should enjoy will be displayed.
